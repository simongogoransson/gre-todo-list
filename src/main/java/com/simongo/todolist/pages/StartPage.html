						<h4>Hello and welcome to Golden Real Estates ToDo App.</h4>

						<p>This nifty little application will help you in your daily work life to keep track and manage
							all tasks concerning the buildings we work with. By enabling you to overview all tasks
							associated with a specific building it makes it possible for you to monitor not only your
							activities but also monitor the progress of your co-workers. Furthermore, the app is easy
							to use and will enable you to excel at your daily work by keeping you updated at your most
							urgent tasks. We are happy to assist you in organizing all the building developments at
							Golden Real Estate.
						</p>
						<p>
							To start using the application please go to the ToDo App page, see link in the top menu bar.
							You will need to sign in by providing your company username. Once signed in, you can see a
							list of all buildings and their respective progress and status. You can add a new building
							to the App or you can select an existing building to view the associated tasks. In this
							page you can see all the details for the selected building such as the activities, the
							status of the tasks and who it's for. You can also add new task for yourself here. To do
							so, click the “create new task” button and enter the data for the task.
						</p>

							A Task can be in 4 different stats:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Pending - a task that no one started working on</li>
							<li>Started - a task that is ongoing</li>
							<li>Completed - task that is finished</li>
							<li>Deleted - task that is removed and not vailid any more (I choose to still show the deleted)</li>
						</ul>

						<p>
							<b><i>I hope this is of great use for you and that it enables you to excel further at your job.</i></b>
